        <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
        <p>Engine tuning is the process of modifying the operating characteristics of an engine. In a typical engine set-up, there are various mechanical and electronic elements such as the intake manifold, spark plugs, and mass air flow sensor. Modern engines employ the use of an engine control unit to provide the best balance between performance and emissions. Via the OBD communications protocol,[5] electronically controlled aspects of the engine can be modified in a process known as mapping. Mapping can either be performed by changing the software within the ECU (chip tuning via firmware modification), or by providing false data via plug-in hardware. Other standalone engine management systems are available; these systems replace the factory computer with one that is user-programmable.
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                Mechanical components of the engine can also be added or replaced, such as forced induction systems like turbochargers or superchargers.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Types of Engine Mods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Forced Induction (aka Turbo or Superchargers)</li>
            <li>Nitrous</li>
            <li>Cold Air Intakes</li>
            <li>Camshafts</li>
            <li>Exhaust Systems</li>
            <li>ECUs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subtitle">History</h2>
        <p>Engine tuning originated with the development of early racing cars and the post-war hot-rod movement.
