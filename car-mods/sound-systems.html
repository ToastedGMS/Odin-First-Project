        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A sound system is a set of equipment for playing recorded music, or for making a band's music able to be heard by everyone at a concert.
        </p>
        <h2>Sound System Components</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In 1954, Acoustic Research (AR) developed the first audio system that extended its bass to 20hz with zero equalization and enclosed in a woofer. This means the sound waves were brought down to very low frequencies. The human ear can only detect frequencies down to 20hz, making sound omnidirectional. These audio systems can then be placed almost anywhere in the room and provide a similar quality of sound, of course with some exceptions. They also penetrate barriers fairly quickly, which is why you can hear your neighbor's car coming from down the block.
                                                                                    
                                                                                            Subwoofers didn't start hitting the market until New Technology Enterprises designed the Servo Statik 1 in 1966. Providing a second winding surrounding a custom 45 cm driver gave better control of the amplifier. They listed it 40% more expensive than traditional loudspeakers at about $1800.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            Another subwoofer design in the late 60s was by Ken Kreisel of Miller and Kreisel Sound Co. When Kreisel's business partner Miller told him customers complained about a lack of bass in the electrostatics, he designed something new. His design replaced the frequencies that were too low in electrostatics but could be handled in subwoofers. Much of the history of subwoofers in cars didn't work well due to space limitations. However, car and audio enthusiasts started installing them in the trunk to save space and keep the car's design intact. Once automotive subwoofers become more common, so did the competition to produce extremely high sound pressure levels in the trunk, otherwise known as SPLs. The “SPL wars” went so far as to modify cars so that top SPL cars cannot even drive normally for the sole purpose of playing earth-shattering music.
